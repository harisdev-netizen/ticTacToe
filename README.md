## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Minimax Algorithm

### What I learned

I discovered a new method to handle SVGs that differs from how I typically use the img tag so that I can quickly change color. Additionally, I developed my understanding of arrays and how to work with them to obtain the results required to determine the game's outcome. For the first time, I used "async await" and promises. I developed the Minimax algorithm to improve computer intelligence and enable it to play the optimal moves.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to progress in javascript because I think that even if my code works it is not optimized.
